operating result have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future our result of operation are subject to fluctuation and other risk including among others competitive pricing pressure resulting in lower average selling price and lower or negative product gross margin expansion of supply from existing competitor and ourselves creating excess market supply causing our average selling price to decline faster than our cost unpredictable or changing demand for our product particularly for certain form factor or capacity excess captive memory output or capacity which could result in write down for excess inventory the application of lower of cost or market charge fixed cost associated with under utilized capacity or other consequence inability to maintain or grow sale through our new channel to which we are selling private label product wafer and component or potential loss of branded product sale a result insufficient non memory material or capacity from our supplier and contract manufacturer to meet demand or increase in cost of non memory material or capacity price increase which could result in lower unit and gigabyte demand potentially leading to reduced revenue and or excess inventory le than anticipated demand including general economic weakness in our market insufficient supply from captive flash memory source and inability to obtain non captive flash memory supply in the time frame necessary to meet demand increased purchase of non captive flash memory which typically cost more than captive flash memory and may be of le consistent quality increased memory component and other cost a result of currency exchange rate fluctuation to the s dollar particularly with respect to the japanese yen inability to adequately invest in future technology and product while controlling operating expense our license and royalty revenue may fluctuate or decline significantly in the future due to license agreement renewal non renewal or if licensee fail to perform on portion or all of their contractual obligation inability to develop or unexpected difficulty or delay in developing manufacturing with acceptable

advance of customer purchase order timing volume and cost of wafer production from flash venture a impacted by fab start up delay and cost technology transition yield or production interruption disruption in the manufacturing operation of supplier including supplier of sole sourced component potential delay in the emergence of new market and product for nand based flash memory and acceptance of our product in these market timing of sell through and the financial liquidity and strength of our distributor and retail customer error or defect in our product caused by among other thing error or defect in the memory or controller component including memory and non memory component we procure from third party supplier and the other factor described under risk factor and elsewhere in this report number table of content competitive pricing pressure and excess supply have resulted in lower average selling price and negative product gross margin in the past and if we do not experience adequate price elasticity our revenue may decline for more than year through number the nand flash memory industry wa characterized by supply exceeding demand which led to significant decline in average selling price price decline exceeded our cost decline in fiscal year number number and number significant price decline resulted in negative product gross margin in fiscal year number and the first quarter of fiscal year number price decline may be influenced by among other factor supply exceeding demand macroeconomic factor technology transition conversion of industry dram capacity to nand and new technology or other strategic action taken by u or our competitor to gain market share if our technology transition take longer or are more costly than anticipated to complete or our cost reduction fail to keep pace with the rate of price decline our product gross margin and operating result will be negatively impacted which could lead to quarterly or annual net loss over our history price decrease have generally been more than offset by increased unit demand and demand for product with increased storage capacity however in fiscal year number and the first half of number price decline outpaced unit and megabyte growth resulting in reduced revenue a compared to prior comparable period there can be no assurance that current and future price reduction will result in sufficient demand for increased product capacity or unit sale which could harm our revenue and margin price increase could reduce our overall product revenue and harm our financial position in the first half of fiscal year number we increased price in order to improve profitability price increase can result in reduced growth in gigabyte demand or even an absolute reduction in gigabyte demand for example in the second quarter of fiscal year number our average selling price per gigabyte increased number and our gigabyte sold decreased number both on sequential quarter basis if we continue to raise price in order to improve our profit margin our product revenue may be harmed and we may have excess inventory we require an adequate level of product gross margin to continue to invest in our business we experienced negative product gross margin for fiscal year number and the first quarter of fiscal year number due to sustained aggressive industry price decline a well a inventory charge primarily due to lower of cost or market write down while product gross margin improved in fiscal year number our ability to sustain sufficient product gross margin and profitability on quarterly or annual basis in the future depends in part on industry and our supply demand balance our ability to reduce cost per gigabyte at an equal or higher rate than price decline per gigabyte our ability to develop new product and technology the rate of growth of our target market the competitive position of our product the continued acceptance of our product by our customer and our ability to manage expense if we fail to maintain adequate product gross margin and profitability our business and financial condition would be harmed and we may have to reduce curtail or terminate certain business activity sale to small number of customer represent significant portion of our revenue and if we were to lose one of our major licensee or customer or experience any material reduction in order from any of our customer our revenue and operating result would suffer in fiscal year number number and number revenue from our top number customer or licensee accounted for approximately number number and number of our revenue all customer were individually le than number of our total revenue in fiscal year number and number in fiscal year number samsung accounted for number of our total revenue through combination of license and royalty and product revenue the composition of our major customer base ha changed over time including shift between oem and retail based customer and we expect fluctuation to continue a our market and strategy evolve which could make our revenue le predictable from period to period if we were to lose one of our major customer or licensee or experience any material reduction in order from any of our customer or in sale of licensed product by our licensee our revenue and operating result would suffer our non compliance with the contractual term of significant customer contract may harm the business covered under these contract and our financial result additionally our license and royalty revenue may decline significantly in the future a our existing license agreement and patent expire or if licensee fail to perform on portion or all of their contractual obligation a an example we expect our license and royalty revenue will decline in fiscal year number due to new license agreement with an existing licensee at lower effective royalty rate a compared to the previous license agreement our sale are generally made from standard purchase order rather than long term contract accordingly our customer may generally terminate or reduce their purchase from u at any time without notice or penalty number table of content our revenue depend in part on the success of product sold by our oem customer significant portion of our sale are to oems which either bundle or embed our flash memory product with their product such a mobile phone gps device and computer our sale to these customer are dependent upon the oems choosing our product over those of our competitor and on the oems ability to create introduce market and sell their product successfully in their market should our oem customer be unsuccessful in selling their current or future product that include our product or should they decide to not use our product our result of operation and financial condition could be harmed in number we added oems to whom we are selling private label product wafer and component the sale to these oems could be more variable than the sale to our historical customer base and these oems may be more inclined to switch to an alternative supplier based on short term price fluctuation sale to these oems could also cause decline in our branded product sale in addition we are selling certain customized product and if the intended customer doe not purchase these product a scheduled we may incur excess inventory or rework cost our business depends significantly upon sale through retailer and distributor and if our retailer and distributor are not successful we could experience reduced sale substantial product return or increased price protection any of which would negatively impact our business financial condition and result of operation significant portion of our sale are made through retailer either directly or through distributor sale through these channel typically include right to return unsold inventory and protection against price decline a well a participation in various cooperative marketing program a result we do not recognize revenue until after the product ha been sold through to the end user in the case of sale to retailer or to our distributor customer in the case of sale to distributor price protection against decline in our selling price ha the effect of reducing our deferred revenue and eventually our revenue if our retailer and distributor are not successful due to weak consumer retail demand caused by an economic downturn decline in consumer confidence or other factor we could continue to experience reduced sale a well a substantial product return or price protection claim which would harm our business financial condition and result of operation except in limited circumstance we do not have exclusive relationship with our retailer or distributor and therefore must rely on them to effectively sell our product over those of our competitor certain of our retail and distributor partner are experiencing financial difficulty and prolonged negative economic condition could cause liquidity issue for our retail and distributor customer and channel for example two of our north american retail customer circuit city store inc and ritz camera center inc filed for bankruptcy protection in number and number respectively negative change in customer credit worthiness the ability of our customer to access credit or the bankruptcy or shutdown of any of our significant retail or distribution partner would harm our revenue and our ability to collect outstanding receivable balance in addition we have certain retail customer to which we provide inventory on consigned basis and bankruptcy or shutdown of these customer could preclude u from taking possession of our consigned inventory which could result in inventory charge the future growth of our business depends on the development and performance of new market and product for nand based flash memory our future growth is dependent on development of new market new application and new product for nand based flash memory historically the digital camera market provided the majority of our revenue but it is now more mature market and the mobile handset market ha emerged a the largest segment of our revenue other market for flash memory include digital audio and video player usb drive and ssds we cannot assure you that the use of flash memory in mobile handset or other existing market and product will develop and grow fast enough or that new market will adopt nand flash technology in general or our product in particular to enable u to grow our revenue and future growth is also significantly dependent on international market and we may face difficulty entering or maintaining sale in some international market some international market are subject to higher degree of commodity pricing or tariff and import tax than in the s subjecting u to increased risk of pricing and margin pressure number table of content our strategy of investing in captive manufacturing source could harm u if our competitor are able to produce product at lower cost or if industry supply exceeds demand we secure captive source of nand through our significant investment in manufacturing capacity we believe that by investing in captive source of nand we are able to develop and obtain supply at the lowest cost and access supply during period of high demand our significant investment in manufacturing capacity require u to obtain and guarantee capital equipment lease and use available cash which could be used for other corporate purpose to the extent we secure manufacturing capacity and supply that is in excess of demand or our cost is not competitive with other nand supplier we may not achieve an adequate return on our significant investment and our revenue gross margin and related market share may be harmed we may also incur increased inventory or impairment charge related to our captive manufacturing investment and may not be able to exit those investment without significant cost to u for example we recorded charge of number million and number million in fiscal year number and the first quarter of fiscal year number respectively for adverse purchase commitment associated with under utilization of flash venture capacity for the number day period in which we had non cancelable production plan utilizing le than our share of flash venture full capacity our business and the market we address are subject to significant fluctuation in supply and demand and our commitment to flash venture may result in period of significant excess inventory the start of production by flash alliance at the end of fiscal year number and the ramp of production in fiscal year number increased our captive supply and resulted in excess inventory while we restructured and reduced our total capacity at flash venture in the first quarter of fiscal year number our obligation to purchase number of the supply or pay number of the cost from flash venture could continue to harm our business and result of operation if our committed supply exceeds demand for our product the adverse effect could include among other thing significant decrease in our product price and significant excess obsolete or lower of cost or market inventory write down or under utilization charge such a those we experienced in fiscal year number which would harm our gross margin and could result in the impairment of our investment in flash venture we continually seek to develop new application product technology and standard which may not be widely adopted by consumer or if adopted may reduce demand for our older product and our competitor seek to develop new standard which could reduce demand for our product we continually devote significant resource to the development of new application product and standard and the enhancement of existing product and standard with higher memory capacity and other enhanced feature any new application product technology standard or enhancement we develop may not be commercially successful the success of new product introduction is dependent on number of factor including market acceptance our ability to manage risk associated with new product and production ramp issue new application such a the adoption of flash based ssds that are designed to replace hard disk drive in device such a notebook and desktop computer can take several year to develop we cannot guarantee that manufacturer will adopt ssds or that this market will grow a we anticipate for the ssd market to become sizeable the cost of flash memory must decline significantly from current level so that the product cost for the end consumer is compelling we believe this will require u to implement multi level cell or mlc technology into our ssds and that will require u to develop highly capable controller there can be no assurance that our mlc based ssds will complete development will be able to meet the specification required to gain customer qualification and acceptance or will be delivered to the market on timely basis for example in july number we communicated that we were late to the market with our gnumber ssd product other new product such a slotmusic slotradio and our pre loaded flash memory card may not gain market acceptance and we may not be successful in penetrating the new market that we target sony recent announcement that it intends to transition it future device from the memory stick format to the sd format could negatively impact our market share or margin since there are greater number of competitor selling sd product number table of content new application may require significant up front investment with no assurance of long term commercial success or profitability a we introduce new standard or technology it can take time for these new standard or technology to be adopted for consumer to accept and transition to these new standard or technology and for significant sale to be generated if at all competitor or other market participant could seek to develop new standard for flash memory product that if accepted by device manufacturer or consumer could reduce demand for our product for example certain handset manufacturer and flash memory chip producer are currently advocating and developing new standard referred to a universal flash storage or ufs for flash memory card used in mobile phone intel corporation or intel and micron technology inc or micron have also developed new specification for nand flash interface called open nand flash interface or onfi which would be used primarily in computing device broad acceptance of new standard technology or product may reduce demand for some of our product that may be based on different standard if this decreased demand is not offset by increased demand for new form factor or product that we offer our result of operation would be harmed alternative storage solution such a high bandwidth wireless or internet based storage including cloud computing could reduce the need for physical flash storage within electronic device these alternative technology could negatively impact the overall market for flash based product which could seriously harm our result of operation consumer device that use nand based flash memory do so in either removable card or an embedded format we offer nand based flash memory product in both category however our market share is strongest for removable flash memory product if designer and manufacturer of consumer device including mobile phone increase their usage of embedded flash memory we may not be able to sustain our market share in addition if nand based flash memory is used in an embedded format we would have le opportunity to influence the capacity of the nand based flash product and we would not have the opportunity for additional after market retail sale related to these consumer device or mobile phone any loss of market share or reduction in the average capacity of our product sale or any loss in our retail after market opportunity could harm our operating result and business condition in addition we are investing in future alternative technology particularly our numberd semiconductor memory we are investing significant resource to develop this technology for multiple read write application however there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing this or other technology or that we will be able to achieve the yield quality or capacity to be cost competitive with existing or other alternative technology we face competition from numerous manufacturer and marketer of product using flash memory a well a from manufacturer of new and alternative technology and if we cannot compete effectively our result of operation and financial condition will suffer our competitor include many large company that may have greater advanced wafer manufacturing capacity substantially greater financial technical marketing and other resource and more diversified business than we do which may allow them to produce flash memory chip in high volume at low cost and to sell these flash memory chip themselves or to our flash card competitor at low cost some of our competitor may sell their flash memory chip at or below their true manufacturing cost to gain market share and to cover their fixed cost such practice occurred in the dram industry during period of excess supply and resulted in substantial loss in the dram industry our primary semiconductor competitor include hynix semiconductor inc or hynix intel micron samsung and toshiba these current and future competitor produce or could produce alternative flash or other memory technology that compete against our nand based flash memory technology or our alternative technology which may reduce demand or accelerate price decline for nand furthermore the future rate of scaling of the nand based flash technology design that we employ may slow down significantly which would slow down cost reduction that are fundamental to the adoption of flash memory technology in new application if the scaling of nand based flash technology slows down or alternative technology prove to be more economical our business would be harmed and our investment in captive fabrication facility could be impaired our cost reduction activity are dependent in part on the purchase of new specialized manufacturing equipment and if this equipment is not generally available or is allocated to our competitor our ability to reduce cost could be limited number table of content we also compete with flash memory card manufacturer and resellers these company purchase or have captive supply of flash memory component and assemble memory card our primary competitor currently include among others data buffalo cnmemory dane elec memory kodak elecom fuji gemalto hagiwara hama imation memorex o data kingmax kingston lexar micron netac panasonic pny pqi ritek samsung sony stmicroelectronics toshiba transcend and verbatim some of our competitor have substantially greater resource than we do have well recognized brand name or have the ability to operate their business on lower margin than we do the success of our competitor may adversely affect our future revenue or margin and may result in the loss of our key customer for example toshiba and other manufacturer have increased their market share of flash memory card for mobile phone including the microsd card which have been significant driver of our growth in the digital audio market we face competition from well established company such a apple archos coby creative royal philip electronics microsoft samsung and sony in the usb flash drive market we face competition from large number of competitor including hynix imation kingston lexar memorex pny sony and verbatim in the market for ssds we face competition from large nand flash producer such a intel samsung and toshiba a well a from hard drive manufacturer such a seagate samsung western digital and others who have established relationship with computer manufacturer we also face competition from third party solid state drive solution provider such a data kingston phison electronics corporation stec and transcend we sell flash memory in the form of white label card wafer or component to certain company who sell flash product that may ultimately compete with sandisk branded product in the retail or oem channel this could harm the sandisk branded market share and reduce our sale and profit furthermore many company are pursuing new or alternative technology or alternative form of nand such a phase change and charge trap flash technology which may compete with nand based flash memory new or alternative technology if successfully developed by our competitor and if we are unable to scale our technology on an equivalent basis could provide an advantage to these competitor these new or alternative technology may enable product that are smaller have higher capacity lower cost lower power consumption or have other advantage if we cannot compete effectively our result of operation and financial condition will suffer we believe that our ability to compete successfully depends on number of factor including price quality and on time delivery of product product performance availability and differentiation success in developing new application and new market segment sufficient availability of cost efficient supply efficiency of production ownership and monetization of intellectual property right timing of new product announcement or introduction the development of industry standard and format the number and nature of competitor in given market and general market and economic condition there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future number table of content our financial performance can depend significantly on worldwide economic condition and the related impact on level of consumer spending which have deteriorated in many country and region including the s and may not recover in the foreseeable future demand for our product is adversely affected by negative macroeconomic factor affecting consumer spending the tightening of consumer credit low level of consumer liquidity and volatility in credit and equity market have weakened consumer confidence and decreased consumer spending these and other economic factor have reduced demand growth for our product and harmed our business financial condition and result of operation and to the extent such economic condition continue they could cause further harm to our business financial condition and result of operation our license and royalty revenue may fluctuate or decline significantly in the future due to license agreement renewal or if licensee fail to perform on portion or all of their contractual obligation if our existing licensee do not renew their license upon expiration and we are not successful in signing new licensee in the future our license revenue profitability and cash provided by operating activity would be harmed for example in the fourth quarter of fiscal year number our license and royalty revenue declined due to new license agreement with an existing licensee at lower effective royalty rate a compared to the previous license agreement to the extent that we are unable to renew license agreement under similar term or at all our financial result would be adversely impacted by the reduced license and royalty revenue and we may incur significant patent litigation cost to enforce our patent against these licensee if our licensee fail to perform on portion or all of their contractual obligation we may incur cost to enforce the term of our license and there can be no assurance that our enforcement and collection effort will be effective in addition we may be subject to dispute claim or other disagreement on the timing amount or collection of royalty or license payment under our existing license agreement under certain condition portion or the entire outstanding lease obligation related to flash venture master equipment lease agreement could be accelerated which would harm our business result of operation cash flow and liquidity flash venture master lease agreement contain customary covenant for japanese lease facility in addition to containing customary event of default related to flash venture that could result in an acceleration of flash venture obligation the master lease agreement contain an acceleration clause for certain event of default related to u a guarantor including among other thing our failure to maintain minimum stockholder equity of at least number number billion and our failure to maintain minimum corporate rating of either bb from standard poor or p or moody corporation or minimum corporate rating of bb from rating investment information inc or i a of january number number flash venture were in compliance with all of their master lease covenant while our p credit rating wa two level below the required minimum corporate rating threshold from p our i credit rating wa bbb one level above the required minimum corporate rating threshold from i if i were to downgrade our credit rating below the minimum corporate rating threshold flash venture would become non compliant with certain covenant under it master equipment lease agreement and would be required to negotiate resolution to the non compliance to avoid acceleration of the obligation under such agreement such resolution could include among other thing supplementary security to be supplied by u a guarantor or increased interest rate or waiver fee should the lessor decide they need additional collateral or financial consideration if an event of default occurs and if we failed to reach resolution we may be required to pay portion or the entire outstanding lease obligation up to number number billion based upon the exchange rate at january number number covered by our guarantee under the flash venture master lease agreement which would significantly reduce our cash position and may force u to seek additional financing which may or may not be available number table of content the semiconductor industry is subject to significant downturn that have harmed our business financial condition and result of operation in the past and may do so in the future the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change rapid product obsolescence price decline evolving standard short product life cycle and wide fluctuation in product supply and demand the industry ha experienced significant downturn often in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycle of both semiconductor company and their customer product and decline in general economic condition the flash memory industry ha recently experienced significant excess supply reduced demand high inventory level and accelerated decline in selling price if we again experience oversupply of nand based flash product we may be forced to hold excessive inventory sell our inventory below cost and record inventory write down all of which would place additional pressure on our result of operation and our cash position we depend on flash venture and third party for silicon supply and any disruption or shortage in our supply from these source will reduce our revenue earnings and gross margin all of our flash memory product require silicon supply for the memory and controller component the substantial majority of our flash memory is currently supplied by flash venture and to much lesser extent by third party silicon supplier any disruption or shortage in supply of flash memory from our captive or non captive source would harm our operating result the risk of supply disruption are magnified at toshiba yokkaichi japan operation where flash venture are operated and toshiba foundry capacity is located earthquake and power outage have resulted in production line stoppage and loss of wafer in yokkaichi and similar stoppage and loss may occur in the future for example in the first quarter of fiscal year number brief power outage occurred at fab number which resulted in loss of wafer and significant cost associated with bringing the fab back on line in addition the yokkaichi location is often subject to earthquake which could result in production stoppage loss of wafer and the incurrence of significant cost moreover toshiba employee that produce flash venture product are covered by collective bargaining agreement and any strike or other job action by those employee could interrupt our wafer supply from flash venture if we have disruption in our captive wafer supply or if our non captive source fail to supply wafer in the amount and at the time we expect or we do not place order with sufficient lead time to receive non captive supply we may not have sufficient supply to meet demand and our operating result could be harmed currently our controller wafer are manufactured by smic tsmc and umc any disruption in the manufacturing operation of our controller wafer vendor would result in delivery delay adversely affect our ability to make timely shipment of our product and harm our operating result until we could qualify an alternate source of supply for our controller wafer which could take several quarter to complete in time of significant growth in global demand for flash memory demand from our customer may outstrip the supply of flash memory and controller available to u from our current source if our silicon vendor are unable to satisfy our requirement on competitive term or at all we may lose potential sale and market share and our business financial condition and operating result may suffer any disruption or delay in supply from our silicon source could significantly harm our business financial condition and result of operation number table of content if actual manufacturing yield are lower than our expectation this may result in increased cost and product shortage the fabrication of our product requires wafer to be produced in highly controlled and ultra clean environment semiconductor manufacturing yield and product reliability are function of both design and manufacturing process technology and production delay may be caused by equipment malfunction fabrication facility accident or human error yield problem may not be identified or improved until an actual product is manufactured and can be tested a result yield problem may not be identified until the wafer are well into the production process we have from time to time experienced yield that have adversely affected our business and result of operation we have experienced adverse yield on more than one occasion when we have transitioned to new generation of product if actual yield are low we will experience higher cost and reduced product supply which could harm our business financial condition and result of operation for example if the production ramp and or yield of number nanometer number bit per cell and number bit per cell nand technology wafer doe not increase a expected our cost competitiveness would be harmed we may not have adequate supply or the right product mix to meet demand and our business financial condition and result of operation will be harmed we depend on our captive assembly and test manufacturing facility in china and our business could be harmed if this facility doe not perform a planned our reliance on our captive assembly and test manufacturing facility near shanghai china ha increased significantly and we now utilize this factory to satisfy significant portion of our assembly and test requirement and also to produce product with leading edge technology such a multi stack die package any delay or interruption in the production ramp or targeted yield or any quality issue at our captive facility could harm our result of operation and financial condition we depend on our third party subcontractor and our business could be harmed if our subcontractor do not perform a planned we rely on third party subcontractor for portion of our wafer testing ic assembly product assembly product testing and order fulfillment from time to time our subcontractor have experienced difficulty meeting our requirement if we are unable to increase the capacity of our current subcontractor or qualify and engage additional subcontractor we may not be able to meet demand for our product we do not have long term contract with our existing subcontractor nor do we expect to have long term contract with any new subcontractor we do not have exclusive relationship with any of our subcontractor and therefore cannot guarantee that they will devote sufficient resource to manufacturing our product we are not able to directly control product delivery schedule furthermore we manufacture on turnkey basis with some of our subcontractor in these arrangement we do not have visibility and control of their inventory of purchased part necessary to build our product or of the progress of our product through their assembly line any significant problem that occur at our subcontractor or their failure to perform at the level we expect could lead to product shortage or quality assurance problem either of which would have adverse effect on our operating result in transitioning to new process product and silicon source we face production and market acceptance risk that may cause significant product delay cost overrun or performance issue that could harm our business successive generation of our product have incorporated semiconductor with greater memory capacity per chip the transition to new generation of product such a product containing number nanometer process technology and or number bit per cell and number bit per cell nand technology is highly complex and requires new controller new test procedure potentially new equipment and modification to numerous aspect of any manufacturing process a well a extensive qualification of the new product by our oem customer and u there can be no assurance that these transition or other future technology transition will occur on schedule or at the yield or cost that we anticipate if flash venture encounter difficulty in transitioning to new technology our cost per gigabyte may not remain competitive with the cost achieved by other flash memory producer which would harm our gross margin and financial result in addition we could face design manufacturing and equipment challenge when transitioning to the next generation of technology beyond nand any material delay in development or qualification schedule could delay delivery and harm our operating result we have periodically experienced significant delay in the development and volume production ramp up of our product similar delay could occur in the future and could harm our business financial condition and result of operation number table of content our product may contain error or defect which could result in the rejection of our product product recall damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resource and increased service cost and warranty claim and litigation our product are complex must meet stringent user requirement may contain error or defect and the majority of our product are warrantied for up to ten year generally our oem customer have more stringent requirement than other customer and increase in oem product revenue could require additional cost to test product or increase service cost and warranty claim error or defect in our product may be caused by among other thing error or defect in the memory or controller component including component we procure from non captive source in addition the substantial majority of our flash memory is supplied by flash venture and if the wafer contain error or defect our overall supply could be adversely affected these factor could result in the rejection of our product damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resource increased customer service and support cost indemnification of our customer product recall cost warranty claim and litigation we record an allowance for warranty and similar cost in connection with sale of our product but actual warranty and similar cost may be significantly higher than our recorded estimate and result in an adverse effect on our result of operation and financial condition our new product have from time to time been introduced with design and production error at rate higher than the error rate in our established product we must estimate warranty and similar cost for new product without historical information and actual cost may significantly exceed our recorded estimate warranty and similar cost may be even more difficult to estimate a we increase our use of non captive supply underestimation of our warranty and similar cost would have an adverse effect on our result of operation and financial condition from time to time we overestimate our requirement and build excess inventory or underestimate our requirement and have shortage of supply either of which harm our financial result the majority of our product are sold directly or indirectly into consumer market which are difficult to accurately forecast also substantial majority of our quarterly sale are from order received and fulfilled in that quarter additionally we depend upon timely reporting from our retail and distributor customer a to their inventory level and sale of our product in order to forecast demand for our product we have in the past significantly over forecasted or under forecasted actual demand for our product the failure to accurately forecast demand for our product will result in lost sale or excess inventory both of which will harm our business financial condition and result of operation in addition we may increase our inventory in anticipation of increased demand or a captive wafer capacity ramp if demand doe not materialize we may be forced to write down excess inventory or write down inventory to the lower of cost or market a wa the case in fiscal year number which may harm our financial condition and result of operation during period of excess supply in the market for our flash memory product we may lose market share to competitor who aggressively lower their price in order to remain competitive we may be forced to sell inventory below cost if we lose market share due to price competition or if we must write down inventory our result of operation and financial condition could be harmed conversely under condition of tight flash memory supply we may be unable to adequately increase our production volume or secure sufficient supply in order to maintain our market share in addition longer than anticipated lead time for advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment or higher than expected equipment cost could negatively impact our ability to meet our supply requirement or to reduce future production cost if we are unable to maintain market share our result of operation and financial condition could be harmed our ability to respond to change in market condition from our forecast is limited by our purchasing arrangement with our silicon source some of these arrangement provide that the first three month of our rolling six month projected supply requirement are fixed and we may make only limited percentage change in the second three month of the period covered by our supply requirement projection we have some non silicon component which have long lead time requiring u to place order several month in advance of our anticipated demand the extended period of time to secure these long lead time part increase our risk that forecast will vary substantially from actual demand which could lead to excess inventory or loss of sale number table of content we rely on our supplier and contract manufacturer some of which are the sole source of supply for our non memory component and capacity limitation or the absence of back up supplier expose our supply chain to unanticipated disruption or potential additional cost we do not have long term supply agreement with most of these vendor from time to time certain material may become difficult or more expensive to obtain which could impact our ability to meet demand and could harm our profitability our business financial condition and operating result could be significantly harmed by delay or reduction in shipment if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantity of these component or develop alternative source of supply in timely manner or at all our global operation and operation at flash venture and third party subcontractor are subject to risk for which we may not be adequately insured our global operation are subject to many risk including error and omission infrastructure disruption such a large scale outage or interruption of service from utility or telecommunication provider supply chain interruption third party liability and fire or natural disaster no assurance can be given that we will not incur loss beyond the limit of or outside the scope of coverage of our insurance policy from time to time various type of insurance have not been available on commercially acceptable term or in some case at all we cannot assure you that in the future we will be able to maintain existing insurance coverage or that premium will not increase substantially we maintain limited insurance coverage and in some case no coverage for natural disaster and sudden and accidental environmental damage a these type of insurance are sometimes not available or available only at prohibitive cost for example our test and assembly facility in shanghai china on which we have significant dependence may not be adequately insured against all potential loss accordingly we may be subject to an uninsured or under insured loss in such situation we depend upon toshiba to obtain and maintain sufficient property business interruption and other insurance for flash venture if toshiba fails to do so we could suffer significant unreimbursable loss and such failure could also cause flash venture to breach various financing covenant in addition we insure against property loss and business interruption resulting from the risk incurred at our third party subcontractor however we have limited control a to how those sub contractor run their operation and manage their risk and a result we may not be adequately insured we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation that could negatively impact our business result of operation and financial condition significant portion of our business is conducted in currency other than the s dollar which expose u to adverse change in foreign currency exchange rate these exposure may change over time a our business and business practice evolve and they could harm our financial result and cash flow our most significant exposure is related to our purchase of nand flash memory from flash venture which are denominated in japanese yen for example in the last year the japanese yen ha significantly appreciated relative to the s dollar and this ha increased our cost of nand flash wafer negatively impacting our gross margin and result of operation in addition our investment in flash venture are denominated in japanese yen and adverse change in the exchange rate could increase the cost to u of future funding or increase our exposure to asset impairment we also have foreign currency exposure related to certain non s dollar denominated revenue and operating expense in europe and asia additionally we have exposure to emerging market currency which can be extremely volatile an increase in the value of the s dollar could increase the real cost to our customer of our product in those market outside the s where we sell in dollar and weakened s dollar could increase local operating expense and the cost of raw material to the extent purchased in foreign currency we also have significant monetary asset and liability that are denominated in non functional currency number table of content we enter into foreign exchange forward and cross currency swap contract to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuation on certain foreign currency asset and liability in addition we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flow with foreign exchange forward and option contract we generally have not hedged our future investment and distribution denominated in japanese yen related to flash venture our attempt to hedge against currency risk may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our result of operation in addition if we do not successfully manage our hedging program in accordance with current accounting guideline we may be subject to adverse accounting treatment of our hedging program which could harm our result of operation there can be no assurance that this hedging program will be economically beneficial to u further the ability to enter into foreign exchange contract with financial institution is based upon our available credit from such institution and compliance with covenant and or other restriction operating loss third party downgrade of our credit rating or instability in the worldwide financial market could impact our ability to effectively manage our foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk which could negatively impact our business result of operation and financial condition we may need to raise additional financing which could be difficult to obtain and which if not obtained in satisfactory amount may prevent u from funding flash venture developing or enhancing our product taking advantage of future opportunity growing our business or responding to competitive pressure or unanticipated industry change any of which could harm our business we currently believe that we have sufficient cash resource to fund our operation a well a our anticipated investment in flash venture for at least the next twelve month however we may decide to raise additional fund to maintain the strength of our balance sheet and we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable term if at all the current worldwide financing environment is challenging which could make it more difficult for u to raise fund on reasonable term or at all from time to time we may decide to raise additional fund through equity public or private debt or lease financing if we issue additional equity security our stockholder will experience dilution and the new equity security may have right preference or privilege senior to those of existing holder of common stock if we raise fund through debt or lease financing we will have to pay interest and may be subject to restrictive covenant which could harm our business if we cannot raise fund on acceptable term if and when needed our credit rating may be downgraded and we may not be able to develop or enhance our technology or product fulfill our obligation to flash venture take advantage of future opportunity grow our business or respond to competitive pressure or unanticipated industry change any of which could harm our business we may be unable to protect our intellectual property right which would harm our business financial condition and result of operation we rely on combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret law confidentiality procedure and licensing arrangement to protect our intellectual property right in the past we have been involved in significant and expensive dispute regarding our intellectual property right and those of others including claim that we may be infringing third party patent trademark and other intellectual property right we expect that we will be involved in similar dispute in the future we cannot assure you that any of our existing patent will continue to be held valid if challenged patent will be issued for any of our pending application any claim allowed from existing or pending patent will have sufficient scope or strength our patent will be issued in the primary country where our product are sold in order to protect our right and potential commercial advantage or any of our product or technology do not infringe on the patent of other company number table of content in addition our competitor may be able to design their product around our patent and other proprietary right we also have patent cross license agreement with several of our leading competitor under these agreement we have enabled competitor to manufacture and sell product that incorporate technology covered by our patent while we obtain license and royalty revenue or other consideration for these license if we continue to license our patent to our competitor competition may increase and may harm our business financial condition and result of operation there are both flash memory producer and flash memory card manufacturer who we believe may require license from u enforcement of our right often requires litigation if we bring patent infringement action and are not successful our competitor would be able to use similar technology to compete with u moreover the defendant in such an action may successfully countersue u for infringement of their patent or assert counterclaim that our patent are invalid or unenforceable if we do not prevail in the defense of patent infringement claim we could be required to pay substantial damage cease the manufacture use and sale of infringing product expend significant resource to develop non infringing technology discontinue the use of specific process or obtain license to the technology infringed for example on october number number we initiated two patent infringement action in the united state district court for the western district of wisconsin and one action in the united state international trade commission or itc against certain company that manufacture sell and import usb flash drive compactflash card multimedia card mpnumber medium player and or other removable flash storage product in this itc action an initial determination wa issued in april number and final determination wa issued in october number finding non infringement of certain accused flash memory product there can be no assurance that we will be successful in future patent infringement action or that the validity of the asserted patent will be preserved or that we will not face counterclaim of the nature described above we and certain of our officer are currently and may in the future be involved in litigation including litigation regarding our intellectual property right or those of third party which may be costly may divert the effort of our key personnel and could result in adverse court ruling which could materially harm our business we are involved in number of lawsuit including among others several case involving our patent and the patent of third party we are the plaintiff in some of these action and the defendant in other of these action some of the action seek injunction against the sale of our product and or substantial monetary damage which if granted or awarded could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation we and numerous other company have been sued in the united state district court of the northern district of california in purported consumer class action alleging conspiracy to fix raise maintain or stabilize the pricing of flash memory and concealment thereof in violation of state and federal law the lawsuit purport to be on behalf of class of purchaser of flash memory the lawsuit seek restitution injunction and damage including treble damage in an unspecified amount we are unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuit and investigation the cost of discovery and defense in these action a well a the final resolution of these alleged violation of antitrust law could result in significant liability and expense and may harm our business financial condition and result of operation litigation is subject to inherent risk and uncertainty that may cause actual result to differ materially from our expectation factor that could cause litigation result to differ include but are not limited to the discovery of previously unknown fact change in the law or in the interpretation of law and uncertainty associated with the judicial decision making process if we receive an adverse judgment in any litigation we could be required to pay substantial damage and or cease the manufacture use and sale of product litigation including intellectual property litigation can be complex can extend for protracted period of time can be very expensive and the expense can be unpredictable litigation initiated by u could also result in counter claim against u which could increase the cost associated with the litigation and result in our payment of damage or other judgment against u in addition litigation may divert the effort and attention of some of our key personnel number table of content from time to time we have sued and may in the future sue third party in order to protect our intellectual property right party that we have sued and that we may sue for patent infringement may countersue u for infringing their patent if we are held to infringe the intellectual property or related right of others we may need to spend significant resource to develop non infringing technology or obtain license from third

the consumer electronics market are subject to seasonality for example sale have typically increased significantly in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year sometimes followed by significant decline in the first quarter of the following fiscal year this seasonality make it more difficult for u to forecast our business especially in the current global economic environment and it corresponding decline in consumer confidence which may impact typical seasonal trend if our forecast are inaccurate we may lose market share or procure excess inventory or inappropriately increase or decrease our operating expense any of which could harm our business financial condition and result of operation this seasonality also may lead to higher volatility in our stock price the need for significant working capital investment in receivables and inventory and our need to build inventory level in advance of our most active selling season because of our international business and operation we must comply with numerous international law and regulation and we are vulnerable to political instability and other risk related to international operation currently large portion of our revenue is derived from our international operation and all of our product are produced overseas in china japan and taiwan we are therefore affected by the political economic labor environmental public health and military condition in these country for example china doe not currently have comprehensive and highly developed legal system particularly with respect to the protection of intellectual property right this result among other thing in the prevalence of counterfeit good in china the enforcement of existing and future law and contract remains uncertain and the implementation and interpretation of such law may be inconsistent such inconsistency could lead to piracy and degradation of our intellectual property protection although we engage in effort to prevent counterfeit product from entering the market those effort may not be successful our result of operation and financial condition could be harmed by the sale of counterfeit product our international business activity could also be limited or disrupted by any of the following factor the need to comply with foreign government regulation change in diplomatic and trade relationship reduced sale to our customer or interruption to our manufacturing process in the pacific rim that may arise from regional issue in asia imposition of regulatory requirement tariff import and export restriction and other barrier and restriction change in or the particular application of government regulation duty and or fee related to custom entry for our product which are all manufactured offshore longer payment cycle and greater difficulty in account receivable collection adverse tax rule and regulation weak protection of our intellectual property right delay in product shipment due to local custom restriction and delay in research and development that may arise from political unrest at our development center in israel number table of content our stock price and convertible note price have been and may continue to be volatile which could result in investor losing all or part of their investment the market price of our stock and convertible note have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future we believe that such fluctuation will continue a result of many factor including financing plan future announcement concerning u our competitor or our principal customer regarding financial result or expectation technological innovation industry supply or demand dynamic new product introduction governmental regulation the commencement or result of litigation or change in earnings estimate by analyst in addition in recent year the stock market ha experienced significant price and volume fluctuation and the market price of the security of high technology and semiconductor company have been especially volatile often for reason outside the control of the particular company these fluctuation a well a general economic political and market condition may have an adverse affect on the market price of our common stock a well a the price of our outstanding convertible note we may engage in business combination that are dilutive to existing stockholder result in unanticipated accounting charge or otherwise harm our result of operation and result in difficulty in assimilating and integrating the operation personnel technology product and information system of acquired company or business we continually evaluate and explore strategic opportunity a they arise including business combination strategic partnership collaboration capital investment and the purchase licensing or sale of asset if we issue equity security in connection with an acquisition the issuance may be dilutive to our existing stockholder alternatively acquisition made entirely or partially for cash would reduce our cash reserve acquisition may require significant capital infusion typically entail many risk and could result in difficulty in assimilating and integrating the operation personnel technology product and information system of acquired company we may experience delay in the timing and successful integration of acquired technology and product development through volume production unanticipated cost and expenditure changing relationship with customer supplier and strategic partner or contractual intellectual property or employment issue in addition key personnel of an acquired company may decide not to work for u the acquisition of another company or it product and technology may also result in our entering into geographic or business market in which we have little or no prior experience these challenge could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and employee harm our reputation subject u to an increased risk of intellectual property and other litigation and increase our expense these challenge are magnified a the size of the acquisition increase and we cannot assure you that we will realize the intended benefit of any acquisition acquisition may require large one time charge and can result in increased debt or contingent liability adverse tax consequence substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charge the amortization of identifiable purchased intangible asset or impairment of goodwill any of which could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition or result of operation merger and acquisition of high technology company are inherently risky and subject to many factor outside of our control and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisition will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operating result or financial condition failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisition could materially harm our business and operating result even when an acquired company ha already developed and marketed product there can be no assurance that such product will be successful after the closing will not cannibalize sale of our existing product that product enhancement will be made in timely fashion or that pre acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issue that might arise with respect to such company failed business

government response thereto may negatively impact our operation revenue cost and stock price terrorist attack s military response to these attack war threat of war and any corresponding decline in consumer confidence could have negative impact on consumer demand any of these event may disrupt our operation or those of our customer and supplier and may affect the availability of material needed

or future period the financial cost and our attention and time devoted to defending income tax position may divert resource from our business operation which could harm our business and profitability the irs audit may also impact the timing and or amount of our refund claim in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by change in the mix of earnings in country with

the vast majority of our nand flash memory supply requirement through our significant flash venture relationship with toshiba which provide u with leading edge low cost memory wafer our removable card product are used in wide range of consumer electronics device such a mobile phone digital camera gaming device and laptop computer our embedded flash product are used in mobile phone navigation device gaming system imaging device and computing platform for computing platform we provide high speed high capacity storage solution known a ssds that can be used in lieu of hard disk drive in variety of computing device number table of content our result are primarily driven by worldwide demand for flash storage device which in turn depends on end user demand for electronic product we believe the market for flash storage is generally price elastic accordingly we expect that a we reduce the price of our flash device consumer will demand an increasing number of gigabyte and or unit of memory and that over time new market will emerge in order to profitably capitalize on price elasticity of demand in the market for flash storage product we must reduce our cost per gigabyte at rate similar to the change in selling price per gigabyte and the average capacity and or the number of unit of our product must grow enough to offset price decline we seek to achieve these cost reduction through technology improvement primarily by increasing the amount of memory stored in given area of silicon effective december number number we implemented change in accounting and have separately accounted for the liability and equity component of our number senior convertible note due number that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement in manner that reflects our

equity the company ha also reclassified certain distribution to non controlling interest from cash flow from operating activity to cash flow from investing activity for fiscal year ended december number number and december number number in the fourth quarter of fiscal year number we identified that our third party equity software contained feature that resulted in incorrect share based compensation expense this software feature affected our share based compensation expense reported for the nine month ended september number number and the three fiscal year ended december number number we determined that the impact of the underreported share based compensation expense wa not material to any of the previously issued annual or interim financial statement accordingly the fourth quarter and full fiscal year number include cumulative non cash adjustment of number number million to increase share based compensation allocated to multiple expense category fiscal year number included number week a compared to number week in fiscal year number and number critical accounting policy estimate our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and result of operation is based upon our consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state or s gaap use of estimate the preparation of these financial statement requires u to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent liability on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimate including among others those related to customer program and incentive product return bad debt inventory and related reserve investment long lived asset income tax warranty obligation restructuring contingency share based compensation and litigation we base our estimate on historical experience and on other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for our judgment about the carrying value of asset and liability when those value are not readily apparent from other source estimate have historically approximated actual result however future result will differ from these estimate under different assumption and condition number table of content revenue recognition sale return and allowance and sale incentive program we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete a evidenced by an agreement with the customer there is transfer of title and acceptance if applicable fixed pricing and reasonable assurance of realization revenue is generally recognized at the time of shipment for customer not eligible for price protection and or right of return sale made to distributor and retailer are generally under agreement allowing price protection and or right of return and therefore the sale and related cost of these transaction are deferred until the retailer or distributor sell the merchandise to their end customer or the right of return expire at january number number and december number number deferred income from sale to distributor and retailer wa number number million and number number million respectively estimated sale return are provided for a reduction to product revenue and deferred revenue and were not material for any period presented in our consolidated financial statement we record estimated reduction to revenue or to deferred revenue for customer and distributor incentive program and offering including price protection promotion co op advertising and other volume based incentive and expected return additionally we have incentive program that require u to estimate based on historical experience the number of customer who will actually redeem the incentive all sale incentive program are recorded a an offset to product revenue or deferred revenue in calculating the value of sale incentive program actual and estimated activity is used based upon reported weekly sell through data from our customer the timing and resolution of these claim could materially impact product revenue or deferred revenue in addition actual return and rebate in any future period could differ from our estimate which could impact the revenue we report inventory and inventory valuation inventory are stated at the lower of cost first in first out or market market value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by estimated cost of disposal the determination of market value involves numerous judgment including estimating average selling price based upon recent sale industry trend existing customer order current contract price industry analysis of supply and demand and seasonal factor should actual market condition differ from our estimate our future result of operation could be materially affected the valuation of inventory also requires u to estimate obsolete or excess inventory the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires u to estimate the future demand for our product within specific time horizon generally six to twelve month to the extent our demand forecast for specific product is le than both our product on hand and on noncancelable order we could be required to record additional inventory reserve which would have negative impact on our gross margin deferred tax asset we must make certain estimate in determining income tax expense for financial statement purpose these estimate occur in the calculation of certain tax asset and liability which arise from difference in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purpose we have recorded valuation allowance against significant portion of our s and certain foreign net deferred tax asset a there wa substantial uncertainty a to the realizability of the deferred tax asset in future period in determining the need for and amount of our valuation allowance we ass the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax asset using historical level of income estimate of future income and tax planning strategy our estimate of future income include our internal projection and various internal estimate and certain external source which we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain our estimate for tax uncertainty require substantial judgment based upon the period of occurrence complexity of the matter available federal tax case law interpretation of foreign law and regulation and other estimate there is no assurance that domestic or international tax authority will agree with the tax position we have taken which could materially impact future result number table of content valuation of long lived asset intangible asset and equity method investment we perform test for impairment of long lived and intangible asset and equity method investment whenever event or circumstance suggest that other long lived asset may not be recoverable an impairment of long lived and intangible asset are only deemed to have occurred if the sum of the forecasted undiscounted future cash flow related to the asset are le than the carrying value of the asset we are testing for impairment if the forecasted cash flow are le than the carrying value then we must write down the carrying value to it estimated fair value based primarily upon forecasted discounted cash flow an impairment of an equity method investment is deemed to occur if the fair value based upon quoted market price if available or forecasted discounted cash flow is le than the carrying value substantially all of our equity method investment are not actively traded and we rely on discounted cash flow to estimate fair value these forecasted discounted cash flow include estimate and assumption related to revenue growth rate and operating margin risk adjusted discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital future economic and market condition and determination of appropriate market comparables our estimate of market segment growth and our market segment share and cost are based on historical data various internal estimate and certain external source and are based on assumption that are consistent with the plan and estimate we are using to manage the underlying business our business consists of both established and emerging technology and our forecast for emerging technology are based upon internal estimate and external source rather than historical information if future forecast are revised they may indicate or require future impairment charge we base our fair value estimate on assumption we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future result may differ from those estimate fair value of investment in debt instrument there are three level of input that may be used to measure fair value see note number investment and fair value measurement in the note to the consolidated financial statement included in item number of this report each level of input ha different level of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value level number security represent quoted price in active market and therefore do not require significant management judgment our level number security are primarily valued using quoted market price for similar instrument and nonbinding market price that are corroborated by observable market data we use input such a actual trade data benchmark yield broker dealer quote and other similar data which are obtained from independent pricing vendor quoted market price or other source to determine the ultimate fair value of our asset and liability the input and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information compared to multiple independent valuation source and could be adjusted based on market index or other information in the current market environment the assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective however given the relative reliability of the input we use to value our investment portfolio and because substantially all of our valuation input are obtained using quoted market price for similar or identical asset we do not believe that the nature of estimate and assumption wa material to the valuation of our cash equivalent short and long term marketable security we currently do not have any investment that use level number input number table of content result of operation product revenue the increase in our fiscal year number product revenue compared to fiscal year number reflected number increase in the number of gigabyte sold partially offset by number reduction in average selling price per gigabyte the increase in number of gigabyte sold wa the result of an increase in average capacity of number and an increase in memory unit sold of number the decline in retail product revenue in fiscal year

been previously partially reserved in fiscal year number to reflect the market value of certain inventory which wa determined to be below cost the increase in product gross margin in fiscal year number a compared with fiscal year number wa also due to charge in number for the impairment of our investment in flash venture of number million and for adverse purchase commitment of number million associated with under utilization of flash venture capacity the rate of decline in average selling price per gigabyte slowed in fiscal year number due to an improved balance between supply and demand impacted in part by our action in early fiscal year number to sell portion of our manufacturing capacity in flash venture to toshiba and hold the remaining wafer output capacity constant the rate of cost decline of our memory product wa similar in fiscal year number and number product gross margin in fiscal year number decreased number number percentage point compared to fiscal year number primarily due to aggressive industry price decline resulting in the sale of product at negative gross margin and related charge the related charge in fiscal year number included inventory reserve primarily to reduce the carrying value to the lower of cost or market for both inventory on hand and in the channel of number million charge of number million for adverse purchase commitment

measure reconciliation of net income loss management belief that providing this additional information is useful to the investor to better ass and understand operating performance especially when comparing result with previous period or forecasting performance for future period primarily because management typically monitor the business excluding these item management also us these non gaap measure to establish operational goal and for measuring performance for compensation purpose however analysis of result on non gaap basis should be used a complement to and in conjunction with and not a replacement for data presented in accordance with gaap management belief that the presentation of non gaap measure including net income loss and non gaap net income loss per diluted share provides important supplemental information to management and investor about financial and business trend relating to the company result of operation management belief that the use of these non gaap financial measure also provides consistency and comparability with our past financial report management ha historically used these non gaap measure when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the item described below provides an additional measure of our core operating result and facilitates comparison of our core operating performance against prior period and our business model objective we have chosen to provide this information to investor to enable them to perform additional analysis of past present and future operating performance and a supplemental

expense consist primarily of expense for employee stock option employee restricted stock unit and the employee stock purchase plan although share based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of sandisk employee and executive we exclude share based compensation expense from our non gaap measure primarily because they are non cash expense that we do not believe are reflective of ongoing operating result further we believe that it is useful to exclude share based compensation expense for investor to better understand the long term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our result to those of peer company impairment of goodwill and acquisition related intangible asset this item reflects the write down of goodwill and other intangible asset to their fair value because of the infrequent nature of this charge management doe not include this type of item in internal operating forecast and model excluding this data provides investor with basis to compare our core operating result in different period without this variability amortization of acquisition related intangible asset we incur amortization of intangible asset in connection with acquisition since we do not acquire business on predictable cycle we exclude these item in order to provide investor and others with consistent basis for comparison across accounting period inventory step up expense related to msystems acquisition this is an acquisition related charge it result from marking to fair value an acquired company inventory at the time of acquisition this charge is not factored into management evaluation of potential acquisition or our performance after completion of acquisition because it is not related to our core operating performance and the frequency and amount of this type of charge can vary significantly based on the size and timing of our acquisition excluding this data provides investor with basis to compare the company against the performance of other company without this variability convertible debt interest this is the non cash economic interest expense relating to the implied value of the equity conversion component of the convertible debt the value of the equity conversion component is treated a debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the note using the effective interest rate method we exclude this non cash interest expense a it doe not represent the semi annual cash interest payment made to our note holder income tax adjustment this amount is used to present each of the amount described above on an after tax basis considering jurisdictional tax rate consistent with the presentation of non gaap net income it also represents the amount of tax expense or benefit that we would record considering jurisdictional tax rate if we did not have any valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset from time to time in the future there may be other item that we may exclude if we believe that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investor and management number table of content limitation of relying on non gaap financial measure we have incurred and will incur in the future many of the cost excluded from the non gaap measure including share based compensation expense impairment of goodwill and acquisition related intangible asset amortization of acquisition related intangible asset and other acquisition related cost convertible debt interest expense and income tax adjustment these measure should be considered in addition to result prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered substitute for or superior to gaap result these non gaap measure may be different than the non gaap measure used by other company number table of content
